Superold project where I created a webapplication to help with planing, and especially visualize the concept of that only one thing can be worked on at a time, and will therefore postpone other things.

Live collaboration in rearranging order of projects.

Used MySQL, jQuery, websocket, jade for templating, not even a frontend framework used.

Just a little nostaligic project.
